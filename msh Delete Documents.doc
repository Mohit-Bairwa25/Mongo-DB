This page uses the following mongosh methods:

db.collection.deleteMany()
db.collection.deleteOne()

To specify equality conditions, use <field>:<value> expressions in the query filter document:
{ <field1>: <value1>, ... }


A query filter document can use the query operators to specify conditions in the following form:
{ <field1>: { <operator1>: <value1> }, ... }

Delete Only One Document that Matches a Condition
To delete at most a single document that matches a specified filter (even though multiple documents may match the specified filter) use the db.collection.deleteOne() method.
The following example deletes the first document where status is "D":

db.inventory.deleteOne( { status: "D" } )


The following example removes all documents from the inventory collection where the status field equals "A":
db.inventory.deleteMany({ status : "A" })


The method returns a document with the status of the operation. For more information and examples, see deleteMany().
