In Security Database Access, Either You Can Create a New User
or Use Admin User

The Thing with Password is You Can Always Genrate New Password without Remembering Old Password
use autogenrated Password & Copy it

Suppose your Password is
T7kKVn4uWnWzXEwI

Deployment>Database>Cluster>Connect
select MongoDb Compass, You will Get a Link Like this

mongodb+srv://mohitbairwa25:<password>@clustermohit.gza9z66.mongodb.net/

So in MongoDb Comapss You have to New Connection

mongodb+srv://mohitbairwa25:T7kKVn4uWnWzXEwI@clustermohit.gza9z66.mongodb.net/
only this format will Work

Now Create a New database, Do a Entry
go to mongodb atlas, click on browse Collections, there you can see an entry
